    <h2> Is St. Louis City's violent crime reporting misleading? </h2>
    <div style="width: 60%; margin: auto;">
    <p> This is the question I asked myself when I began research about the reputation of the St. Louis area. 
        After all, St. Louis City frequently appears as a top 10 entry in violent city lists. I've always just
        glanced over this, and took it completely at face value that St. Louis City is very dangerous. Although,
        while researching the reputation of St. Louis City, I discovered that the city and the county had split 
        apart from each other in 1876 in an extremely narrow vote. This makes St. Louis one of only three independent
        cities (St. Louis, Missouri; Baltimore, Maryland; Carson City, Nevada) outside of Virginia (which has different rules for cities). This immediately
        made my brain shift to how St. Louis City being independent affects the crime data of the area. So from there, my research pivoted.
        I wanted to create a combined dataset to show how St. Louis crime would be represented if it was still combined with St. Louis County. 
        First, I needed to figure out what metric is used to measure how "dangerous" a city is. As I have never analyzed any crime-related 
        data before this, I needed to know what sort of data I was looking for for this analysis. Looking at multiple lists of the "most dangerous cities in the U.S," 
        I figured out that they used a metric of violent crime rate per 100,000 people. This is a relatively simple number to calculate.
        The equation for violent crime rate per 100,000 is: (Total Incidents/Total Population) * 100,000. From there, I needed to get the total incidents and total population.
        Since I was looking at creating a combined dataset of the the violent crime in both areas, I needed to get the violent crime data from both St. Louis City and St. Louis County.
        This made me look at what violent crime was composed of. Violent crime is composed of four separate crime categories: Homicide, Forcible Sex Offenses, Robberies, and Aggravated Assault.
        Luckily, you can easily find the crime reports for 2021-2023 of both St. Louis City and St. Louis County relatively easily through NIBRS. St. Louis County actually has
        their crime statistics on ArcGIS which I thought was neat since we actually covered ArcGIS in class; they have an easily navigable map composed of the data, but I was more
        interested in the actual json files they had of their data. Once I got both the St. Louis City and St. Louis County violent crime data, I took note of it all in a spreadsheet.
        After I had the data I needed, I needed an easy way to create a data visualization. I ended up using Flourish to create easily-embeddable graphs; below are 9 pie charts of
        the violent crime data I recorded from the NIBRS. Each row is 2021 > 2022 > 2023; each column is County > City > Together (data).
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/17669333"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
        These numbers came out to be pretty much around where I expected them to be. The only major difference to what I assumed is that STL County actually has only an average of
        1430 crimes less than STL City. The majority of crime each year is aggravated assault, and STL City seems to have a pretty large amount of robberies each year. I have no
        clue if these statistics are common knowledge, this is coming from somebody who has no bias/any idea about the crime that takes place in these areas. From this data, I was
        able to get the number I was looking for: violent crime rate per 100,000 people. All I had to do was take the data from these pie charts and plug it into the equation
        I stated earlier. This is the comparion graph I got:
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/17703164"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
        As you can see from this graph, the combined dataset provides a much lower violent crime rate per 100,000.
    </p>
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        I think the combined dataset offers a much more accurate represenation of crime in the St. Louis area. Due to the fact that St. Louis City crime is reported separately
        from St. Louis County's, you miss out on a lot of the population that St. Louis County has, which is where the majority of St. Louis residents live. St. Louis City
        population is about ~300,000 (with the number dropping each year) and St. Louis County population is about ~990,000; together, St. Louis County makes up about 
        77-78% of the population of the two areas combined. So when you take only the City's population into account when getting the violent crime rate per 100,000,
        which is how St. Louis City's violent crime rate per 100,000 is reported, from an area that has most of its population living in the suburban areas,
        I feel like you get a very unfair representation of the violent crime rate of St. Louis. The number isn't even close either. This new combined dataset number would drop
        the city of St. Louis out of the top 10 on every list, and make it a more middle of the pack city when it comes to violent crime statistics. Obviously, this number still comes
        with its flaws. You can still argue from these numbers that St. Louis City has a problem with robbery or that the city itself still has a major problem with crime, but I think 
        it is more fair to the city to include the county when representing violent crime as basically every other large city has many, many suburbs included in their population, while
        St. Louis City does not have this luxury. While not perfect, I think the comparison of the combined dataset vs. the dataset of just the city is something to keep in mind regarding
        the reputation of St. Louis and if it is properly represented by articles about its crime, and puts St. Louis in a much more fair light than it currently is.
